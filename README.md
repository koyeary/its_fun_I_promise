# its_fun_I_promise

I updated the index but need to review git hub commands before I mess with it anymore. Here are notes to the changes I made:

Starting with Jonathan's code:

Made one minor change--added strict equal to line 18 because when I tested the appVersion function is was sometimes incorrect.

Then I added several functions for the geolocation section:
1 - determines geolocation
2 - identifies latitude and longitude from the geolocation coordinates
3 - boolean function that determines, based on longitude, what half of the country the user lives in.

That's as far as I got,the next step is (probably?) to create an event listener that will redirect you based on the result of the third function.
